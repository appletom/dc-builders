# BONUS Exercise 3: Full Stack Forum App

1. Using Express, write a server that implements a Forum.
1. Create a /public subfolder, and use express.static() to server a website from /public
1. Implement a Forum website (keep the UI simple!)
1. Users on your Forum website should be able to:
    * Start a new forum thread
    * View all active forum threads
    * Comment on a particular thread
1. Your website should interact with your API to manage the Forum state. The forum that your website renders should always be in sync with the API's version!
