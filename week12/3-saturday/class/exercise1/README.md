# Exercise 1: Full Stack Counter App

1. Using Express, write a server that implements a counter. (You may use the counter server you implemented from previous classes).
1. Create a /public subfolder, and use express.static() to server a website from /public
1. Implement a Counter website (keep the UI simple!)
1. Users on your Counter website should be able to:
    1. Increment the counter
    1. Decrement the counter
    1. Reset the counter to 0
1. This is just a client side app! Nothing is syncing with the server. Add an API to the express server that will update the data on the server.
