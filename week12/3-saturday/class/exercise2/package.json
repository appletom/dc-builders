  "description": "1. Using Express, write a server that implements a todo list. (You may use the todo-list server you implemented last class). 2. Create a /public subfolder, and use express.static() to server a website from /public 3. Implement a Todo-list website (keep the UI simple!) 4. Users on your Todo-list website should be able to:     * add todos     * delete todos     * edit the text for a todo     * BONUS - mark todos as \"completed\" (this will require a new API route!) 5. Your website should interact with your API to manage the todo-list state. The todo list that your website renders should always be in sync with the API's todo list!",
