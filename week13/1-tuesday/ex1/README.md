# My Tool Shed Database

Create a database that keeps tracks of everything in your tool shed. Name it whatever you would like. You will need one table that stores the information for all of your tools as well as the columns which will help you categorize them. Add the columns below.

* name
* date_purchased
* rating (for much you like it on a scale of 1 to 5)
* is_good_condition

Pay particular attention to the data types you will need to assign to each one of these.
