# Week 6 â€“ Saturday

## Agenda
1. Review JavaScript FormData to capture form elements
2. Review JavaScript Promise with asynchronous requests

### 1. Review JavaScript FormData to capture form elements
* you must include a `name` attribute in order for `FormData` to capture user input

### 2. Review JavaScript Promise with asynchronous requests
* `.then` is a giveaway that the function that precedes it returns a promise
* promise are used when we don't know how long it will take for a value to resolve (e.g. be returned)
