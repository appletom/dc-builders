# Exercise 2: Agile Estimation and Planning

Dan is you Product Owner and he demands that everyone in your team inspect the Magic Virtual Pen (TM). You will be passing around said pen and be graded on how many times each team member sees it.

You goal in your breakout room is to (VIRTUALLY) pass a pen around to every member of the room as many times as possible within 1 minute. You will get 4 chances (sprint) to figure out this process. Before each sprint, you must record an estimate of how many laps your pen will go through, then record the actual number. It should look as follows

At the end your table should look like this:
| Sprint # | Estimate | Actual |
|----------|----------|--------|
| 1        |          |        |
| 2        |          |        |
| 3        |          |        |
| 4        |          |        |

Rules:
 - Assign one person in your breakout room to be a timekeeper. They will also record the laps and estimates. This person is your Scrum Master.
 - "Passing" the pen is moving the pen from off the screen, to on the screen, to off the screen.
 - No additional instructions. You must self organize!

 Timekeeping:
 1. 2 Minutes: Prepare you plan
 2. 1 Minute: Estimate and Post in Slack
 3. 1 Minute: Execute!
 4. 1 Minute: Retrospective.
 5. Repeat 2-4 three more times.
