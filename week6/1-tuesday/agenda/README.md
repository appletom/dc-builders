### 1. Review Week 5 – Saturday Agenda
* `<label>`, `<fieldset>`, and `<legend>` are essential for accessibility
* general review

## 2. Introduction to APIs
* an API exposes something which you can consume (i.e. use)
* if it exposes a method, you don't have to know the intricacies of how it works, just what it does
* if it exposes data, you can present that data how you would like, this is where the meaning of _Application Programming Interface_ makes sense because the interfaces for the same data can vary

## 3. Introduction to AJAX
* AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML
* asynchronous means a process can occur in the background without blocking what going on in the foreground
* AJAX is shorthand for making requests to a server which means data is being transferred between a client and a server
* the most common requests are DELETE, GET, PATCH, and POST

## 4. Introduction to Postman
* Postman is an app that simplifies requests to endpoints
* an endpoint is a URL the responds to a request from a client
* it is used to test hitting endpoints before adding the logic to client-side code

## 5. Introduction to jQuery
* jQuery greatly simplifies the use of JavaScript by implementing easier-to-read syntax
* jQuery methods are also much shorter to write than Vanilla JS methods
* jQuery lowered the bar for non CS devs to enter the world of programming

## 6. Introduction to the Network Tab in Dev Tools
* the network tab shows that status of requests made by the client
* network codes in the 200 range generally mean that things worked
* inspecting the response shows the response of a request
