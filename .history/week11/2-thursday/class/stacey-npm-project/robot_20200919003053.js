// ## RobotJS
// RobotJS is a neat module that can automate the inputs on your computer (your mouse, keyboard, etc)

// 1. Write a program that types "I AM A FELLOW HUMAN AND NOT A ROBOT" when you run it

// Type "I AM A FELLOW HUMAN AND NOT A ROBOT".
var robot = require('robotjs');
// robot.typeString("I AM A FELLOW HUMAN AND NOT A ROBOT");
// 2. Write a program that moves your mouse cursor accross the screen in a horizontal line
robot.moveMouse(50, 0);
