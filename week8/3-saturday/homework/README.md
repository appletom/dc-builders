# High Or Low (Optional)

In the `week7/3-saturday/class/demo-jquery-cards` folder, There is a basic HTML template for a High or Low card game, a game of chance. The player can guess if their card is higher or lower than the House card. If they guess right, they get a point. If the cards are the same, the score doesn't change. If they guess wrong, they lose a point.

Your job is to fill in the game logic using everything you know about DOM manipulation, JQuery and Classes. 


## Rules of the Game
1. When you start a game, both cards start face down.
1. You click "Draw" to show the player card. A random card is attached to the dom and the Player card is flipped.
1. You click "High" or "Low" to register your guess about the House card.
1. The House card is assigned a random card image and flipped over.
1. The score is computed from the results and a score is displayed (you may need to add this to the HTML)
1. Hitting Draw at any time will reset the game to start.
1. When a button is not valid, it is disabled.
