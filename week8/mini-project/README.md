# Week 7/8 Mini-Project: Interactive Games with JQuery

## Objective

You goal for this project is build an online interactive game. My suggestion is a simple card game like Blackjack, but you can do any game you wish, as long as you can score the players' performance.

The goal is less about polish and more about finishing, so bugs are OK! This is practice for your Phase 1 project!

* Must use JQuery 
* Do not use the Canvas API
* (Optional) Use high-score API to register scores (TBD)
