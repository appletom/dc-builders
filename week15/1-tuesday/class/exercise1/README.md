1. The first part of this exercise is breaking down the following work into smaller, testable pieces. Please consider writing your task list down and talking it over with your DiR or instructor.
1. Refactor the TODO endpoints into a new file using [Express Routers](https://expressjs.com/en/api.html#router).
1. Instead of SQL commands, you will use [Sequelize Model APIs](https://sequelize.org/master/manual/model-querying-basics.html#simple-update-queries) to perform CRUD actions on todos.
1. Anything left over will be homework!

In case you are panicing now, the previous solution is here (../../../week12/3-saturday/class/exercise2/solution). Make sure you do your homework next time ;) .
